    "In Portland, there is increasing concern about crime occuring near light rail (MAX) stations. This is exacerbated by the fact that there are not enough officers to provide adequate coverage of these increasingly high-crime areas. Furthermore, Portlanders are averse to the creation of an armed transit police force, despite the increasing occurence of violent crime outbreaks on the transit lines. Given this context, it would be of value to identify the MAX stations requiring additional police coverage, which will allow for more efficient and effective distribution of police officers to the areas in which they are needed."

Secondarily, given enough time, additional data could be used to normalize these occurences in order to derive more meaningful insights and make more substantive comparisons between areas."

Aggregated crime counts will need to be input into a dataframe in order to be normalized using population data. A final choropleth could be generated using this result in order to allow for the facilitated visual identification of neighborhoods with higher frequency of crime occurences near MAX stations, per capita."
