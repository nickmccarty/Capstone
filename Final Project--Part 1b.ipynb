Secondarily, given enough time, additional data could be used to normalize these occurences in order to derive more meaningful insights and make more substantive comparisons between areas."

Given the utilization of buffers to aggregate crime counts near MAX stations, specialized libraries will be required (i.e., Shapely and/or GeoPandas) to establish polygons to be used in the requisite spatial analysis. Aggregated crime counts will need to be input into a dataframe in order to be normalized using population data. A final choropleth could be generated using this result in order to allow for the facilitated visual identification of neighborhoods with higher frequency of crime occurences near MAX stations, per capita."
